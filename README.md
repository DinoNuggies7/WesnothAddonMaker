# WesnothAddonMaker
For making your own add-ons for Wesnoth easier and more simple. For now you can only add a new custom Era with up to 8 factions and 8 units each, but I am planning on adding more features in the future.

# Building
`git clone https://github.com/DinoNuggies4665/WesnothAddonMaker.git`

`cd WesnothAddonMaker`

`make` or `make windows` to build for Windows (Not 100% supported, help appreciated)
